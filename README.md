 2. Based on the advantage of local vehicle supply chain
 3. Build our open source vehicle
    * During design,maker could download the digital models(fusion 360) ,reference the PCB module with the help of fusion eagle, Fast build internet of vehicles in mature platform(fusion connect)
    * Maker can output BOM in fusion platform ,and then purchase parts and ask for fabrication in henosv.com
    * Maker would process the detail and then assemble their own vehicle
    * Maker share their own open source case for reference
4. For core team of henosv, we would share the freshest tech and research some parts about new energy vehicle


# We just want to do it step by step
